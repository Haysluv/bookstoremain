        <h1>About Our Shop</h1><br> 
    <h3><em>Every Book Unlocks A New World</em></h3>
        Thanks for checking out our bookstore! <em>Between the Lines</em>  was established in 2007 
        by Jack  &amp; Emmy Harper.
        We wanted to provide a space for our community to enjoy good books. 
        Through a little effort and support, we were able to open our bookstore 
        with a selection of just a handful of books.
        Now, our selection has grown to include just about anything you might be interested in.
        Our genres include mystery novels, historical fiction, antiquarian books, 
        children's stories, cookbooks, Bibles, and the like!
        We hope you will stop in to see us soon. 
        Keep an eye out for our dog, Murphy! He loves to greet our customers.<br>
